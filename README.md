# Sewage_Infrastructure_Funding

Scrape_Sewage_Data: Takes PDFs provided by the City of Chicago and scrapes data from them about sewage 
	infrastructure projects.

Parse_Sewage_Locations: Takes location data we have scraped from the PDFs and determines how much funding
	has been allocated to a given blockgroup for a given year.

This information will be used to find out where funding has been concentrated and to analyze how equitably the money has
been spread over the city.
