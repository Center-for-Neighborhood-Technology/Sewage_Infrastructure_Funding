'''
After we have finished with the main portion of the data there are 2 things
we need to take care of:

#before we begin coding, we need to exclude the ~100 entries that we do not
#have the block group for either the beginning or the ending point.
#we are going to save those entries for when we are done with these

#another thing we need to keep in mind is that there are some project titles
#that have location information (but there were no locations associated
#with the project) We are, similarly, going to save these until after we have
#finished everything here
